In the below visualisation, we consider 100 simulations of a traveller who intends to catch a flight. In each simulation, the passenger is infected with a viral disease and is subject to scanning which might include thermal scanners (to detect fever) and a follow-up risk-assessment questionnaire to determine if the traveller has recently been in an area where the disease is known to be present.

Exit screening occurs prior to the travel and entry screening upon arrival at the flight's destination. The sensitivity of the screening process is the probability that the screening will detect the disease if the traveller truly has the disease.

Because each country has its own screening processes, we let the sensitivity be different at each end of the journey. If the exit sensitivity is 1, then all infected travellers will be <span style="color:#66C2A5">caught pre-flight</span> and should not be allowed to travel. Passengers who become symptomatic during the flight may be  <span style="color:#8DA0CB">detected at arrival by entry screening</span>. Passengers who become symptomatic after arrival will <span style="color:#FC8D62">not be detected</span> by either screening.
