Given the scenario set out on the left, consider 100 infected air travellers who would arrive at their destination infected. This simulation calculates how many of those 100 travellers are likely to be detected via <b><span style="color:#66C2A5"> exit screening on departure</span></b>, present with <b><span style="color:#E78AC3">severe disease during travel</span></b>, be detected via <b><span style="color:#8DA0CB">entry screening on arrival</span></b> or <b><span style="color:#FC8D62">not be detected</span></b>.

NB: These results are based on a stochastic simulation, and so there may be small variations in the number of travellers in each group when the same parameters are used twice.
